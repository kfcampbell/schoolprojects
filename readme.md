## School Projects

These are some projects I've worked on while attending SCU. Some of them are quite old and I'm embarrassed of their contents. Nonetheless, I've put them here as a way to demonstrate basic proficiency at Android development, python, etc.

Please email kfcampbell@scu.edu if you have any questions.
